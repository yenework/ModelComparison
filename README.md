Comparing Machine Learning Algorithms 
Classification algorithms such as multiple logistic regression (GLM), classification tree (CART) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were developed and the most accurate one among these algorithms was identified.  

The result of the confusion matrix approach shows that multiple logistic regression(GLM), has 97.7378% accuracy, Classification tree (CART) has 97.6948% accuracy and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), has 97.7148% accuracy. The caret approach also shows from its plot and “Accuracy” and “Kappa” value that multiple logistic regression(GLM), is the most accurate algorithm.
